# What is a Startup?

"Startup" is a term first recorded in [1976](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/17/startup-language-idea/) to describe a small, young company with high growth potential. These companies typically leverage technology as an advantage in the market, allowing them to upset or circumvent larger competitors. For example, AirBnb is upsetting the traditional hotel market by allowing guests to book rooms directly with homeowners. Their software and the foundational technology that is now available (ie: the internet) allows them to keep transactions secure and renters safe without the overhead of actually owning expensive property or hiring hourly staff to clean and administer hotels. 

Technology startups may also create solutions to problems so unlike the current solutions that we credit them with making completely new markets. For example, very few people used a "social network" that looked anything like Facebook or Twitter to keep in touch with friends and family before the year 2000. There were "old media" solutions, but the base of technology required for widespread online social networks didn't exist before that time. Once it did, hundreds of competing social networking startups were launched and a new type of business took form.

While my personal experience is in software, startups aren't limited to that medium. Technology hardware startups created personal computers that acted as the "[first wave](https://venturebeat.com/2016/07/10/what-steve-cases-third-wave-means-for-global-startups/)" in the modern startup movement. These early hardware startups enabled software platforms which in turn enabled internet-connected services to take hold, but hardware startups are far from passe. Advances in "wearable" technology in the late 2000's were largely led by startups like Fitbit and Jawbone before being adopted by larger companies like Apple and Samsung. Even today, hardware startups are playing a huge role in the improvement of 3D printing, unmanned flying vehicles, and self-driving cars. The integration of hardware and software at most of these companies has spawned a new world of valuable and exciting opportunities.

The problem with startups is that we often don't hear of them until they are no longer truly startups. Many of the companies I mentioned above are publicly traded or have market values in the billions of dollars (commonly referred to as "[unicorns](http://www.ibtimes.com/real-reason-everyone-calls-billion-dollar-startups-unicorns-2079596)"). While I use some examples in this book from companies that are now recognizable names, I'm not writing this book for product developers and engineers who work at billion-dollar startups. For this reason, I've chosen to make an important distinction: this book is talking about "early stage startups." 

## What does an early stage startup typically look like?

Early stage startups are startups who have not yet found [product/market fit](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html). That means that while the company may have a vision or may have identified a problem in the market, they are not yet sure how they will solve that problem in a profitable way. They are typically experimenting, building prototypes, and talking to customers to get feedback.

Typically early stage startups are either funded by investors (external parties who are willing to take a financial risk on the new venture in exchange for an ownership stake) by debt (less likely for a startup than a traditional small business, but sometimes founders take personal debt to fund their companies) or by the founders of the startup (either from their pockets or through "[sweat equity](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweatequity.asp)").  

It's important to note that "early" is a relative term. In a hardware or pharmaceutical startup, you may need to raise a significant amount of money just to build a prototype of your product and test it in the market. In a software startup, 

## How are "startups" different from small businesses?

The term is thrown around pretty liberally now, and I often hear it used to refer to any small business.
