# 3. A Scalable Product Development Process

At some point you'll outgrow the MVP phase and you'll need to start building real software. Ideally this will happen gradually as you outgrow elements of your cobbled together MVP. You may not really even notice when this happens, but eventually your business' needs will be greater than the cost and time savings you get from third party services pulled together with hacky glue code. Now it's time to build some software.

Before you jump in with both feet and start creating an amazing, multi-tiered architecture with the latest tools, automated deployments, and scalable databases, you need to have a process. Even before you have a team of engineers, having a process for product development that ensures reliability, maintainability, and proper prioritization is highly important for a startup. It might be even more important for the lone developer team because your resources are so tight that any deviation from the critical path means a complete stoppage on everything that the business actually needs. Even if you've proven your business' viability with an MVP, you can't afford to waste cycles building things you don't need yet.

In the rest of this chapter I'll offer the process I've used to build software at early stage startups. This process works with a team of 1 engineer all the way up to a team of 5 or 6 engineers. Once you outgrow this process, you're getting out of the "early stage startup" designation, so I'll leave that to another author to cover.

### 1. Long-Term Planning

Early stage startups don't need to do 12 month product plans. I mean, you _can_, but I've never seen one at a < 10 person startup that actually came to fruition. Things are wildly in-flux at this stage, so rather than spending time in long-term planning meetings where you imagine a future you haven't created yet, look at the next 3 months. What things are most critical to your immediate survival and will contribute to your long-term vision while still achieving results in a 3-month timeline? Where can you differentiate yourself from your competition to your first 100 or 1000 customers?

Aim to have 1 long-term planning meeting with the executive team every 3 months where you look back at the big projects you've done in the past quarter and try to prioritize big projects for the upcoming quarter. The structure of this meeting can be as follows:

#### Review the Company's Goals (10 minutes)

Make sure everyone in the room is on the same page about the company's overarching goals before proceeding. Even if you discuss these things in board meetings or internally all the time it helps to have them laid out before the product talk starts.

#### Review the Past Quarter (10 minutes)

If your company has been operating for at least three months and you've had some kind of product development process in place, here's where you can look at what you accomplished last quarter. I like having this disussion just after the one about company goals because often goals at a startup are changing every 3-6 months. It's interesting to see what you've worked on and whether or not it was actually relevant to the company's current trajectory.

The other goal of this bit is to make sure everyone in the room has a realistic idea of what your engineering team (or just you) can accomplish in three months. It's easy to cram a three month roadmap with a dozen huge projects during the planning phase, but much harder to actually execute on them.

#### Prioritize the Problems that Engineering Needs to Solve (35 minutes)

Priorities should change in a startup, but if your biggest problems change every week or all you do is make text and button color changes for three months, it will be a huge waste of your product development team's time. The goal of this session is to come out with an ordered list of the big, impactful product improvements or new features that you want to release in the next three months with the understanding that if development slows down, things lower on the list will not get done. It's okay to have more projects ready than you think you can get done, but make sure everyone in the room knows that is the case.

As the product owner, you should already have done some prework for this. I've always had a good idea what product features were coming based on listening to my company's founders or business team speak, but if you've been more isolated, make sure you have meetings with some of the key decision makers individually. You don't want to be blindsided by a major new feature that is suddenly the most important item on the table.

Another thing to keep in mind is that this is not a planning session. You will not have time to talk about technical soutions to these big problems, but instead you have to keep the conversation focused on the order of the problems you want to solve.

#### Recap (5 minutes)

Finally, go back over your company goals and new product priorities. Do they align? If not, is there a good reason why they don't? It may seem obvious that a startup's technical team should be solving business problems, but all too often startups put their tech teams into solving imaginary problems like scaling before they actually become "problems" for anyone in the business.

As for the execution of meetings like this, sticky notes can be good; a whiteboard will work; a tool like Trello is also good if you've got a large TV or projector for everyone to see.

### 2. Weekly Planning Meetings

When your team is just a few people, your process will be much different from what it becomes with a team of 50 or 100.
