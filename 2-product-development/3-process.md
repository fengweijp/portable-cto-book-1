# 3. A Scalable Product Development Process

At some point you'll outgrow the MVP phase and you'll need to start building custom software. Ideally this will happen gradually as you outgrow elements of your cobbled together MVP. You may not really even notice when this happens, but eventually your business' needs will be greater than the cost and time savings you get from third party services pulled together with hacky glue code. Now it's time to build some software.

Before you jump in with both feet and start creating an amazing, multi-tiered architecture with the latest tools, automated deployments, and scalable databases, you need to have a process. Even before you have a team of engineers, having a process for product development that ensures reliability, maintainability, and proper prioritization is highly important for a startup. It might be even more important for the lone developer team because your resources are so tight that any deviation from the critical path means a complete stoppage on everything that the business actually needs. Even if you've proven your business' viability with an MVP, you can't afford to waste cycles building things you don't need yet.

## Long-Term (3 month) Planning

Early stage startups don't get to do 12 month plans. I mean, you _can_, but I've never seen one at a 10 person startup that actually came to fruition. Things are wildly in-flux at this stage, so rather than spending time in long-term planning meetings where you imagine a future you haven't created yet, look at the next 3 months. What things are most critical to your immediate survival and will contribute to your long-term vision while still achieving results in a 3-month timeline? Where can you differentiate yourself from your competition to your first 100 or 1000 customers?
