# 1. Agile in a Nutshell

One of the most popular organizational frameworks for building software today is Agile. Its tenants of rapid development cycles and iterative changes are especially compelling for startups who don't know exactly what their product needs to be and don't have the resources to build everything they can imagine. Every startup I've been at generated 10 to 100 times as many ideas as they could execute, so the real challenge for product leaders is to prioritize these new developments.

I'm not an expert in Agile, but you don't have to be in order to lead a team of engineers or product developers either. As your organization grows, it will benefit you to either learn more about product development methodologies or hire people who do, but it's helpful if you can at least hold a conversation about Agile and maybe use some of its practices in your early development process. In a later chapter I'll give you a couple product development frameworks that have worked well for myself and others, but I would encourage you to tweak your process as often as you need to.
