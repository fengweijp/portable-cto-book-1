# 1. Agile in a Nutshell

One of the most popular organizational frameworks for building software today is Agile. Its tenants of rapid development cycles and iterative changes are especially compelling for startups who don't know exactly what their product needs to be and don't have the resources to build everything they can imagine. Every startup I've been at generated 10 to 100 times as many ideas as they could execute, so the real challenge for product leaders is to prioritize these new developments.

I'm not an expert in Agile, but you don't have to be in order to lead a team of engineers or product developers either. As your organization grows, it will benefit you to either learn more about product development methodologies or hire people who do, but it's helpful if you can at least hold a conversation about Agile and maybe use some of its practices in your early development process. In a later chapter I'll give you a couple product development frameworks that have worked well for myself and others, but I would encourage you to tweak your process as often as you need to.

## What is Agile?

## Scrum

## Kanban

While not mutually exclusive with Scrum, Kanban is another Agile method based on [a Japanese lean manufacturing system](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/). When applied to software development, [Kanban helps visualize work](https://www.themuse.com/advice/an-underrated-way-for-engineering-teams-to-improve-their-workflow) as it flows through steps in a system and limits the amount of work that is in progress at any given time.

Kanban means "board" in Japanese, so unsurprisingly, the core element of the system's organization is a board. I like [Trello](https://trello.com/) for managing Kanban boards, but you can try other systems or use a real physical board if that works best for your team.

### What Kanban Looks Like

A simple Kanban board might have six columns that show where each piece of work is in the product development cycle. Here's a Kanban board my team might use:

#### Column 1: Backlog

The Backlog column should contain a prioritized list of ideas, bugs, or business needs. The card doesn’t have to have a ton of detail yet, but it should have enough information that your team members understand why it’s important.

#### Column 2: Planning

In this column, a product manager will fill out a specification for the feature by meeting with business stakeholders, engineers, and designers. When it’s ready, he or she will move it to the “Ready for Engineering” column.

#### Column 3: Ready for Engineering

At this stage, all cards should have detailed specifications. While you may still have questions about technical details, the business requirements should be clear.

#### Column 4: In Progress

You can move a card over to “In Progress” at any time. This self-driven “pull” system builds a culture of personal accountability and curiosity.

#### Column 5: Testing

When you have completed work on the card, move it to “Testing” where another engineer (or someone on the QA team) will pick it up.

#### Column 6: Deployed

Another defining feature is that work should be delivered continually to a staging or production environment. This column allows anyone on the team to see what work has been released recently.
