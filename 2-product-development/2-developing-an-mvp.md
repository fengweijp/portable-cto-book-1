# 2. Developing an MVP

"It's more about understanding what to build and if it’s worth building instead of how to build it" - [Thomas Trajan](https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/how-can-you-increase-your-value-as-a-software-engineer-cab9599bbbe)

## What is an MVP?

For most entrepreneurs with an idea it’s hard to compromise on quality. In their mind, the product or service they want to deliver is top-notch, but in reality they rarely have the resources to build anything like what they imagine.

The term MVP, which stands for “minimum viable product” gets thrown around all the time in startups. It was popularized by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup (http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html), which is well worth the weekend it will take you to read.

The goal of an MVP in business development is to create something that meets just enough of the business need to test or validate an assumption, allowing the entrepreneur (or intrapreneur) to save on scarce resources until the project is proven “viable.” In The Lean Startup, Ries says that an MVP is “not necessarily the smallest product imaginable...it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort.”

So an MVP is less about building a product, and more about [learning what your product needs to be](https://steveblank.com/2013/07/22/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-its-about-smart-learning/). I think of the MVP as a “pre-product” phase. Some good examples of an MVP might be:

- A software as a service company runs a pilot service with three paying customers using spreadsheets, online forms, and email.
- An app maker creates mock-ups of his app, creates a free landing page website, and measures the number of people who click the “Download Now” button.
- A writer releases the first three chapters of his book and directs potential buyers to fill out a form with their email address if they want to know when more is released.

There are [dozens of ways you can build an MVP](http://mlsdev.com/en/blog/50-types-of-mvp), but you might have noticed that none of the examples above require work from a software developer. This is intentional. Software is expensive to build and maintain, so an ideal MVP requires no dev work to get out the door. This allows the business team to learn whether or not their idea is viable before they invest heavily in product development.


## Where Does the CTO Fit In?

An early stage CTO who's building an MVP has the job of figuring out how to piece together a "product" that will prove the business' viability as quickly as possible.

Notice that I didn't say an early stage CTO should write a custom CMS, build something in the latest exciting framework, or even write code at all. If you are a software developer then great. You'll have an advantage over startups whose head of product or engineering is less technical. Still, that doesn't mean you should spend a ton of time writing code in the beginning.

Once the business has tested its hypothesis and you're ready to invest in a more robust product, your job will change. You'll need to break out your architecture skills and make decisions about what kind of tech stack to use, the kind of team you want to hire, and the product release cycle you want to employ. In the MVP phase, these decisions don't really matter much.

The truth is that many software startups in the MVP phase [don't need a developer to figure out if their idea is viable](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/creating-a-tech-startup-without-a-developer). They need a way to put their idea into the world, and [plenty of low-cost tools exist for exactly that purpose](http://blog.stridenyc.com/blog/you-dont-need-a-cto-you-need-squarespace/).


## Minimal MVPs

> "Premature scaling is putting the cart before the proverbial horse, and in the case of startups this can potentially relate to both engineering and operations...For the engineering team, there’s the often obsessed about notion of having a robust platform that can handle millions of users before the startup even gets to 10’s of thousands on there. The team starts to worry about all the technical issues that they’ll have to deal with when success comes, but they lose track of what is actually going to make them succeed." - [Michael A. Jackson, Advent Venture Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljacksonvc/)

Many software engineers get stuck in the mindset that a product isn't "good" if it wasn't well-built, tested, and professionally engineered, so I'm devoting the rest of this chapter to show you how real companies have built MVPs with little to no custom development work. These solutions aren't meant to carry a startup through to millions in revenue or "scale", but [more startups have been burned by premature scaling than have been burned by not building a robust enough platform on day 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/startupcompass-public/StartupGenomeReport2_Why_Startups_Fail_v2.pdf).


### Packback's Pivot

Around the middle of my tenure at Packback, we began a "pivot." Our textbook rental platform wasn't picking up traction like we had hoped, so one of our founders came up with a new idea for a product that would eventually become Packback's primary focus.

At the time, however, we didn't know that this new concept would become our biggest revenue generating opportunity, so we didn't start by pulling the engineering team off our existing product. Instead, we cobbled together a stack of services to test our idea before employing our engineering team's time.
