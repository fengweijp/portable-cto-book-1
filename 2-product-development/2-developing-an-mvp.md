# 2. Developing an MVP

"It's more about understanding what to build and if it’s worth building instead of how to build it" - [Thomas Trajan](https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/how-can-you-increase-your-value-as-a-software-engineer-cab9599bbbe)

## What is an MVP?

For most entrepreneurs with an idea it’s hard to compromise on quality. In their mind, the product or service they want to deliver is top-notch, but in reality they rarely have the resources to build anything like what they imagine.

The term MVP, which stands for “minimum viable product” gets thrown around all the time in startups. It was popularized by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup (http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html), which is well worth the weekend it will take you to read.

The goal of an MVP in business development is to create something that meets just enough of the business need to test or validate an assumption, allowing the entrepreneur (or intrapreneur) to save on scarce resources until the project is proven “viable.” In The Lean Startup, Ries says that an MVP is “not necessarily the smallest product imaginable...it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort.”

So an MVP is less about building a product, and more about [learning what your product needs to be](https://steveblank.com/2013/07/22/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-its-about-smart-learning/). I think of the MVP as a “pre-product” phase. Some good examples of an MVP might be:

- A software as a service company runs a pilot service with three paying customers using spreadsheets, online forms, and email.
- An app maker creates mock-ups of his app, creates a free landing page website, and measures the number of people who click the “Download Now” button.
- A writer releases the first three chapters of his book and directs potential buyers to fill out a form with their email address if they want to know when more is released.

There are [dozens of ways you can build an MVP](http://mlsdev.com/en/blog/50-types-of-mvp), but you might have noticed that none of the examples above require work from a software developer. This is intentional. Software development is expensive, so an ideal MVP requires no dev work to get out the door. This allows the business team to learn whether or not their idea is viable before they invest heavily in product development.

## So Where Do You Fit In?

If you are a software developer then great. You'll have an advantage over startups whose head of product or engineering is less technical. Still, that doesn't mean you should spend a ton of time writing code in the beginning.
