## Management

### Building trust within the organization
- Transparency - Show people what you're doing
- Explain technical concepts, they aren't that hard
- Let everyone in the meeting
- Working with founders

### Growth/hiring
- Recruiting: Always be recruiting
- Working with recruiters:
  - they try to push a sense of urgency on you that doesn't exist
  - don't waste time going to their office unless you see the resumes
  - negotiate, but realize that if you're the lowest rate, you get the last pick of the talent
- Interview process
- Onboarding

### Meetings

### Letting people go

### Culture
- Standing up for your team
- Space, volume, comfort
- Encourage balance
- Maker vs. manager calendar, time spent
  - "Makers need long, uninterrupted time to go heads down and create work without any distractions. Managers, on the other hand, are people who coordinate across teams, move teams towards goals, and manage projects. Managers need effective meetings and good, consistent systems for getting status updates." - https://blog.trello.com/productive-team-blueprint-free-guide
