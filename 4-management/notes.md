## Management

### Building trust within the organization
- Transparency - Show people what you're doing
- Explain technical concepts, they aren't that hard
- Let everyone in the meeting
- Working with founders

### Growth/hiring
- Recruiting: Always be recruiting
- Working with recruiters:
  - they try to push a sense of urgency on you that doesn't exist
  - don't waste time going to their office unless you see the resumes
  - negotiate, but realize that if you're the lowest rate, you get the last pick of the talent
- Interview process
- Onboarding

### Metrics
"Ticket trackers grossly understate the impact of your best employees, and grossly overstate the value of your least valuable developers. Why?
Your best developers spend disproportionately more time helping other developers perform at their peak. Their contributions are not easily tracked by project issue trackers.
Likewise, inexperienced developers are what I call “drive by coders.” They’re incentivized by shallow ticket numbers to close issues as fast as they can. They throw a quick fix in the general direction of the problem & leave heaping piles of technical debt in their wake." - https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-build-a-high-velocity-development-team-4b2360d34021

### Meetings
- 4 essential parts to a good meeting: https://blog.trello.com/productive-team-blueprint-free-guide

### Performance reviews
- Weekly checkups
- Quarterly reviews

### Letting people go
- Keeping a paper trail
- Letting them down

### Culture
- Standing up for your team
- Space, volume, comfort
- Encourage balance
- Maker vs. manager calendar, time spent
  - "Makers need long, uninterrupted time to go heads down and create work without any distractions. Managers, on the other hand, are people who coordinate across teams, move teams towards goals, and manage projects. Managers need effective meetings and good, consistent systems for getting status updates." - https://blog.trello.com/productive-team-blueprint-free-guide
