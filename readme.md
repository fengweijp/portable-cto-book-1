# Software Engineering at Early Stage Startups 

The goal of this text is to provide engineers and product developers with insight into what it's like working for an early stage startup (fewer than 10 employees, typically just 1-3 engineers), and a foundation of knowledge that they can use to help them succeed in this role. The advice comes from my personal experience building small engineering teams at seed-funded technology companies, being the sole engineer at a couple of startups, and from countless conversations with peers and mentors in similar roles.

Each section has several chapters roughly the length of a typical blog post. This is an early draft, but I'd eventually like to offer it in book form, so if you're interested, watch or star this repository and I'll keep you updated on my progress. Enjoy!
