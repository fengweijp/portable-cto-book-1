# Patterns for Startup CTOs

The goal of this text is to provide a set of workflows, processes, and patterns for CTOs, engineers, or product managers at early stage startups. This advice comes from my personal experience leading small engineering teams at seed-funded technology companies as well as from countless conversations with peers and mentors in similar roles.

Each section has several chapters roughly the length of a typical blog post. You can read all of the patterns front-to-back, but more likely, you'll want to jump into those most applicable to your current needs. That's fine too. Enjoy!

## Introduction

While much has been written on management, programming, product development, and productivity there is a lack of writing on these topics as they are encountered by CTOs and tech leads and young startup companies.

Our skillsets as startup CTOs are unique. Unlike software developers in large corporations, we can't allow ourselves to be caught up in every minute detail of our software, and unlike corporate CTOs, we can't take our hands out of the day-to-day operations to solely focus on the big picture. We must be hybrids, learning bits and pieces of what would be 5 or 6 different jobs in a larger company because until we get there, someone's got to do everything.

It's possible that this niche - startup CTOs - is not large or marketable enough. Maybe we just don't tend to be big readers? But I've seen an increasing number of technology-enabled companies popping up without great technical leaders in place. When I fell into my first engineering leadership role at a startup, I certainly didn't know where to start. Now that I've come out the other side, I'm piecing together this book for people like my past self.

## Format

This text seeks to provide a library of patterns that can be used by new or experienced CTOs at startups to help make their jobs more approachable and predictable. Like programming books that center on patterns, I'll try to provide examples and edge cases for each pattern here. Also like programming patterns, no one should blindly follow all this advice all the time. Each company, employee, product, and situation is different; it's impossible to write a book that encapsulates every situation a startup CTO will see.

Each chapter will start with a short introduction to the topic, usually framed around a real technology leadership problem. Next, I will lay out a framework for dealing with the issue in a repeatable manner. Finally, I'll offer specific examples of the concept in practice.

I like books with predictable patterns, and like many engineers, my brain enjoys order. That said, what I find orderly may not be right for every reader, so if you find the format distracting I welcome your feedback. This is a repository, so make a pull request if you feel so inclined.
