- Fake It
  - Buffer's story: https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it
- Cobble Together Third Party Services

- Hire Someone Else to Write Code
  - https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/risk-of-offshore-outsourcing
- Write Code
  - Choosing tools and technologies
    - Use well-established, tried and true tech that you know
      - You are not google/amazon/linkedin: https://getpocket.com/a/read/1774906855
    - Pick a language everybody on the team knows well
    - Decouple things as much as is reasonable
    - Don't overcomplicate things until you have to
      - "Often complexity is generated when there is no willingness to recognized that a non fundamental goal of a project is accounting for a very large amount of design complexity, or is making another more important goal very hard to reach, because there is a design tension among a fundamental feature and a non fundamental one." - http://antirez.com/news/112
  - Architecture
    - Decouple things
    - When in doubt, choose the simplest path, you can make it more complex later
    - "Architecture is expensive, especially when a new domain is being explored. Getting the system right seems like a pointless luxury once the system is limping well enough to ship. An investment in architecture usually does not pay off immediately. Indeed, if architectural concerns delay a product’s market entry for too long, then long-term concerns may be moot. Who benefits from an investment in architecture, and when is a return on this investment seen? Money spent on a quick-and-dirty project that allows an immediate entry into the market may be better spent than money spent on elaborate, speculative architectural fishing expedition. It’s hard to recover the value of your architectural assets if you’ve long since gone bankrupt." - Big Ball of Mud, http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html
    - "focus first on features and functionality, then focus on architecture and performance." - Big Ball of Mud, http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html

### [A Product Development Workflow](chapters/3-3-product-workflow.md)
*Need to write*

- https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/prioritization-relative
- What's the point?
  - Organization
  - Transparency: shows everyone what we're working on, what is prioritized, what the tradeoffs are if we switch, etc
  - So you can answer the question when someone asks
- Planning and development cycle
  - Business goals meeting 1x per quarter (more often if needed)
  - Planning meeting every week
  - Demo/release every week
- Iteration
  - Plan for change, flexibility
  - Try new processes
  - Maintain reasonable expectations
  - Ask "why" to everything.


## Part 4: [What Happens Next?](chapters/4-whats-next.md)
- What's next?
  - Fundraising and/or organic growth
  - Hiring, management
- What if we do _too_ well?
  - Premature scaling is worse than hiccups because you have too many customers
- Prepare for your role to change
