# Patterns for Startup CTOs

The goal of this text is to provide a set of patterns for CTOs, engineers, or product managers at early stage startups. This advice comes from my personal experience leading small engineering teams at seed-funded technology companies as well as from countless conversations with peers and mentors in similar roles.

## Introduction

While much has been written on management, programming, product development, and productivity there is a lack of writing on these topics as they are encountered by CTOs and tech leads and young startup companies.

Our skillsets as startup CTOs are unique. Unlike software developers in large corporations, we can't allow ourselves to be caught up in every minute detail of our software, and unlike corporate CTOs, we can't take our hands out of the day-to-day operations to solely focus on the big picture. We must be hybrids, learning bits and pieces of what would be 5 or 6 different jobs in a larger company because until we get there, someone's got to do everything.

It's possible that this niche - startup CTOs - is not large or marketable enough. Maybe we just don't tend to be big readers? But I've seen an increasing number of technology-enabled companies popping up without great technical leaders in place. When I fell into my first engineering leadership role at a startup, I certainly didn't know where to start. Now that I've come out the other side, I'm piecing together this book for people like my past self.
