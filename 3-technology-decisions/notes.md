### How much should CTOs code?
- "Embrace your ability to learn, [but] Be careful not to get so immersed in the minutia that you lose sight of your overall responsibility to drive technology at a broad level." https://www.recode.net/2017/6/15/15332486/cto-code-coding-skills-developer-education-engineer

### Choosing tools and technologies
- Use well-established, tried and true tech that you know
  - You are not google/amazon/linkedin: https://getpocket.com/a/read/1774906855
- Pick a language everybody on the team knows well
- Decouple things as much as is reasonable
- Don't overcomplicate things until you have to
  - "Often complexity is generated when there is no willingness to recognized that a non fundamental goal of a project is accounting for a very large amount of design complexity, or is making another more important goal very hard to reach, because there is a design tension among a fundamental feature and a non fundamental one." - http://antirez.com/news/112

### Testing
- What kind of testing can you do?
- How much testing is appropriate?
- Layers of testing
- Pragmatic testing of a fluid product
- Continuous integration

### Architecture
- Decouple things
- When in doubt, choose the simplest path, you can make it more complex later
