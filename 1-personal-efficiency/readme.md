# Section 1: Personal Efficiency

As the leader of a technology team, you can't expect your employees to achieve a high level of efficiency if you haven't mastered these skills first. Focus and the right attitude will put you on the right path, but maintaining your efficiency when things get busy requires systems.

## Chapter 1: What is a CTO?

Before you dive into your goals and start building processes, it's important to understand what exactly it is you do as a CTO.

It turns out that this isn't quite as simple to define as you might think. CTOs at startups are in a unique situation as their role will change over time as the company evolves and even in larger organizations, "CTO" is a [relatively new role that has yet to be unanimously defined](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.158.1721&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

At an early stage startup, the CTO is generally a catch-all. He will fill in any gaps left unfilled by other product-related employees whether they're engineers, product managers, designers, architects, or QA specialists. This means that a successful CTO at a startup must play many roles in the company, and be ready to learn new skills on the fly. You're not going to be able to hire people to do everything for you on day one. Here are just some of the skills you'll want to ready for as an early stage startup's CTO:

### 1. Lead engineer for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Most people who want a technical co-founder probably want someone to help them build or maintain their minimum viable product. On day 1, your most likely role will be to write and ship code. For CTOs with an engineering background, this role will be the most familiar and comfortable, but don't get too used to it. You'll need to break out and look at the big picture as you grow.

### 2. Product management

Most startups I've seen have a non-technical visionary and a product manager in their CTO. The CTO's goal initially might be to make the visionary's ideas a reality, but at the end of the day, someone has to manage this product development process, put feature requests in order, and make sure things adhere to a process. This is where being a CTO with a product management background can pay off.

### 3. Technology hiring manager

Finding the right engineering talent is one of the hardest things that tech startups have to do. Not only do you have to find people who want to work in a small company with fewer benefits and job security; you need to find engineers with specific established skillsets because you won't have time to train everyone on the job. Besides engineers, hiring IT staff, product managers, designers, and technical support people may fall partially in your lap as well.

### 4. Security specialist

How secure are your company's servers? If you came from a development background, you probably have them covered, but what about your CEO's personal laptop that she also uses for work? Does everyone in your company encrypt their hard drives? Use two-factor authentication in their email? Keep their passwords in a secure password vault? These questions are all your job now, so even if you're not truly a security expert, you're probably the best person for this role at your startup.

### 5. Application architecture

MVP's shouldn't rely on complex architectures if they don't need to, but when the time comes to plan for growth, you'll probably find your role shifting from engineer to architect. While you can hire great senior developers to advise you and implement your plan, as the liason between the business and technology teams, you're in the best spot to make high level architecture decisions as they come up.

### 6. Technical support

As a startup grows, it usually finds the need to hire a customer service person (or a remote service), but what happens when this person or a customer finds a bug? It's unlikely that you've built a quality assurance team (see the next point), so it heads to the CTO to distribute bugs to the team accordingly.

### 7. QA and testing

Once again, I've rarely seen an early stage startup with a dedicated QA team or even single person. Small companies usually come up with a system that splits testing and validation work between developers, but that system is implemented by the CTO.

### 8. DevOps

### 9. Data management

Big data is hot right now, but data scientists are a luxury that smaller startups usually have to wait on. Even if you can collect millions of data points on your customers, it's useless without a CTO who can come up with a decent system for storing and accessing this data securely.

### 10. Vendor relationships

We live in an API-driven world as developers. I can't remember the last time I built a project that didn't connect to at least two or three third party services from Google Analytics to Cloud SQL servers to Amazon S3. It's awesome to have so much power at your fingertips as a developer, but as a CTO it's a lot to manage. You have to know who's updated which libraries, which plan you signed up for, and who's got access to your secret keys.

### 11. Overseeing the version 2.0

At some point in a startup's life-cycle it comes time to rebuild the MVP that is now likely being stretched way beyond its initial use case. Unless your startup has grown incredibly fast or you've pushed this step off for an extra long time, your CTO will probably be doing most of the planning work on this version as well. By this point, his role will be different than it was during the MVP days; now he'll have to manage a team of people rather than build it all himself.

### 12. Team growth management

Another reason that startup CTO's are rarely the same people who work as big company CTO's is that [managing growth of technology team is really hard](http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/2014/07/How-Do-We-Excite2c-Manage2c-and-Retain-the-Tech-Team.aspx). At the beginning you could excite your employees by offering them cool projects with lots of technical challenges. Now you've got to attract more specialized people with benefits, vacation days, and career advancement. Managing growth with 100 employees is totally different than managing growth with 5. 

### 13. Employee retention

Tech workers have options, so it's rare to keep one for more than 2 or 3 years these days. That means that as your startup exits the "tiny startup" phase and enters the "mid-sized startup" phase it's likely that your CTO will start dealing with some churn. Early employees yearn for the excitement of their first months with the company and start looking for new challenges or founding their own companies. The CTO who originally started building this thing alone in his apartment is now trying to convince his best talent to stay and minimize turnover.


As the company grows, the CTO will ideally transition out of a hands-on role and into a true upper management position. Throughout the rest of this text, I hope to give you some tools that will help you make that transition, but it all starts with personal efficiency.
