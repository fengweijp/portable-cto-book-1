# 5. Batching, Focusing, and Delegating

Effective engineering managers must first learn to be effective and efficient engineers. If you're spending every day as a CTO spinning your wheels by bouncing between meetings, answering questions, and things aren't getting done, you've got a problem.

I've found three ideas to be essential for improving my personal productivity as an engineer and engineering leader or CTO. While your strategy for doing these same things may be different, you must learn to focus, batch, and delegate tasks.


## 1. Focusing on the Most Important Tasks

> "You may need to do fifty things a day in New York, but Iâ€™d rather to do some reading in my office and do one to two things a day and do them well," - [Warren Buffet](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/successful-entrepreneurs-secrets-to-mastering-work-life-balance/)

Prioritization is one of the hardest things for startups to do. I think the reason for that is undisciplined founders. For most of their career, they've been forced to go at someone else's speed, obey the rules, and plod through bureaucracy. Now that they've got their startup though, things can change as fast as they can dream them up. This "everything's a priority" feeling will trickle down to you as a CTO and the engineering team you manage, so you've got to be ready.

For example, early in my career I worked at a startup where the founders were young. Investors had given us some money and we had an early version of the product out in the world, but it wasn't taking off like we'd hoped. We didn't have a roadmap; just hypotheses about what would work, and so every day our developers were asked to build new features or pull out existing ones because maybe that would be the magic switch that turned the company around.

Every time an idea came in, it was immediately the most important thing on the table, and all other half-built projects came to a halt. Needless to say, this led to a very poor product and a lot of burnt out employees. Until we hired an engineering/product manager to stem the flow of new ideas and try to organize things, we were running in circles getting very little accomplished.

Now, some of those issues were business issues; some were personality issues; but either way, as the CTO at your startup, it's your job to figure out how to prioritize the flow of ideas from founders, investors, and advisors.

Ideas are cheap. They're easy to produce, and when you start generating them it actually becomes easier to make more. This idea-generation cycle can be challenging for engineers because our work tends to take longer, be more methodical, and need follow-up time to improve. In other words, new projects are rarely completed on their first release; we need time to iterate.

This applies to how you prioritize things for your engineering team, but it also applies to how you prioritize things in your personal workflow. It may be that before your startup has a lot of cash you're the only engineer, and if that's the case prioritization is one of your biggest assets. I'll talk more about product and engineering prioritization later in this book, but for now, let's see what it means to have your personal priorities in order.

### Personal Prioritization

What was the most important thing you did last week at work? What are the three most important things that you've got to get done this week? How many hours did you spend working on them?

You need to be able to answer these questions.

When you're working in a startup as one of the first employees there will be a million opportunities, meetings, and ideas to discuss in addition to articles to read, meetups to attend, and people to meet. While networking and public relations _are_ an important part of an early stage CTO's job, they can't get in the way of the most important tasks you have every week. Here are a few steps you can take to make sure you get your personal work priorities right:

#### 1. Make a to-do list
It's one of the oldest tricks in the book, but it really works. Make a list each week of all the things you want to get done. Make sure your list is reasonably attainable and prioritized from most important to least important.

#### 2. Look at your list every morning
Those are the items you need to work on first. Don't come into the office or open up your laptop and get sucked into emails or Linkedin messages for an hour. That can wait. Instead, spend your first two or three hours of really productive time knocking something off your all-important list each morning.

#### 3. Track your time
I never knew how I was spending my time at work until I downloaded a time-tracking app for my smartphone. Every time I switched tasks I would update the app, and at the end of the week I'd check my time breakdown to see how productive I really was. It might surprise you how little time you really get to spend writing code when you're interrupted by questions or meetings every two hours.


## 2. Batching Similar Work

While tracking what you're doing and keeping an organized list of your priorities will help, you will still inevitably have to do some housekeeping tasks. Answering emails, responding to Slack messages, reviewing pull requests, etc. all take time, but they probably aren't your top priorities for the week.

Batching is a great trick to make those tasks take less time by waiting longer between doing them.

What do I mean by "batching"? Let's look at a simple example.

If you were asked to track the amount of time you spend checking and responding to email every week, you'd find that you probably do it way more often than you think. What do you do when there's a lull in a meeting? How about when you're waiting on someone to meet you for lunch? Email is always there, so it's easy to just hop on your phone and see what's new.

The thing is that 99.9% of a CTO's emails don't have to be answered immediately. If you're honest with yourself you could probably wait until the end of the day or at least until lunch to respond to most of them. Many don't even require a response at all.

So what can you do to stop wasting time on email? Do it less, but budget a block of time for it every day.

Turn off the notifications on your phone and laptop so it's not constantly pinging you, and just set yourself a single once-per-day calendar reminder to check your email at 5pm. Spend 30-60 minutes on it and then leave it until the next afternoon.

Try it for a week and you'll be amazed how much more productive you are during the day. Uninterrupted blocks of time are the key to being a productive developer, so while you're still in charge of writing code or other high-concentration tasks, batch all your smaller tasks and relegate them to specific time slots throughout the week.

Another good example of batching is how you read news or blog posts. If you read every  article that comes into your social feeds as soon as they appear you'll waste way too much time hopping around the web chasing news. Instead, keep a list of links to articles you want to read and set aside an hour every week to sit down and really read them. Not only will you comprehend your reading more this way, you also won't get distracted by every news article that flies at you. You can always read it later.


## 3. Delegating Effectively

A couple of years ago I got to meet and learn from [Nick Sarillo](http://www.nicksarillo.com/), a Chicago restraunt entrepreneur who's been repeatedly recognized for turning out successful restaurants and having engaged, interested employees. Like most new managers, Nick struggled with delegation when he was new at it too. He would try handing off important tasks to his team and then when someone dropped the ball he'd kick himself for not just doing it on his own.

Nick spent a lot of time figuring out delegation though. Unlike a one or two-person software startup, you can't run multiple successful pizza restaurants without being able to delegate, and since many of Nick's employees are high school or college kids, he's really had to think about how he can do it while keeping their chances of failure low.

This framework really resonated with me as a new manager. I have always struggled with giving important tasks to other people. While reading the words here won't fix all your problems, I hope you can take this framework and start using it to build your own system for delegation.

### A Framework for Delegation

#### What
The most obvious spot for delegation to fail is in the "What needs to be done" phase. As a manager, you must outline the expected result in no uncertain terms, and you can't assume that your employees know the same context that you do. Remember, they probably aren't in the same higher-level business meetings as you, so they may not know exactly what you expect from them.

I find this especially important when delegating open-ended research tasks. For example, if I wanted an employee to evaluate a new programming language, framework, or library, I wouldn't give them a task to "Evaluate X". I'd give them a matrix of things I wanted to know about the different options and ask them to fill it out.

Yes, defining a specific "What" like this takes more time than being vague, but the results - the thing we really care about - are much better.

#### Why
You can never give too much context, even when you're just giving an intern a task to complete. Employees will feel more connected to the organization when they understand why they're doing something, and I think this is one of the areas where startups can shine compared with larger corporations.

Large companies have the disadvantage of many layers of management, so the average employee has been told to do something by his manager who was told by her manager who was told by his manager, and up the chain until nobody really knows why they're doing anything.

When you delegate even a simple task, continually stress _why_ you're delegating it, _why_ the company needs it done, and _why_ the person you chose is the best one for the job.

#### Who
You might think this one would be obvious, but I've walked out of meetings before where we all agreed that "X needs to be done," only to realize at our next meeting that noone was actually assigned to be responsible for doing it.

Just because you mention a task or idea in a meeting does not mean your team will take the suggestion and run with it. You have to explicitly delegate each task to a project owner who will ensure that it gets done.

#### How
Be honest, even if you don't want to micromanage someone, as the most senior engineer on the team you may have a really good idea how every task you delegate should be done. If the task is a large one, you may only have a strong opinion on how they complete certain parts of it. Either way, it's your responsibility to define this.

For example, if you have a new feature that you're going to delegate to an employee, you should spell out things even if they seem obvious. For example, where in the code should this feature live? Should it be tested? If so, how thoroughly? What other features might this affect? What can the employee do to minimize side effects during the development of this feature?

Once you have worked with someone a long time they may start to know how you think well enough that you don't have to be as explicit with them, but [it rarely hurts to constrain projects more tightly](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027379/the-psychology-of-limitations-how-and-why-constraints-can-make-you-more-creative).

#### When
Is this project supposed to be done by your meeting next week? Do you need your employee to give you a progress report in three days? If there are time constraints - and any project that is actually going to get done will have time constraints - then set them explicitly. Your cofounders or CEO may be bugging you about something that you've delegated, but the person you delegated to won't feel that same pressure. Instead, just make sure they know what you expect.

I also find it helpful to come up with timelines for projects together rather than to dictate them from the top down. For example, instead of telling an employee that they need to complete a feature by Friday, ask them when they think they can be done. If they say the following Monday and you need it by Friday, dig in and figure out what the employee will have to offset to make you meet your deadline. If you set mandated timelines from the top that never get met, people will never respect them.

#### Check for understanding
Up to this point, I've made it seem that delegation is a one-way street, but that's not the case. As the manager delegating a task, it's your job to make sure it is fully understood and gets done. This may mean sitting down with the employee and having them parrot back your expectations or it may simply mean getting a verbal "Yes." This depends on how long you've worked with the person and how well you work together.

My process for delegation is to write out a short specification using the five question words above ("What", "Why", "Who", "How", "When"). Before I assign work out to an employee, I sit down with them and have them read the spec and explain it to me. This helps us uncover more unknowns and potential issues. Finally, as they work on it, I set checkin points to make sure they still feel confident in their estimated completion time and that they still understand the project.

#### Benefits and consequences
Sometimes the benefits of a project or task are well-understood and sometimes they're not. Sometimes they are already covered in the "Why" section above, but sometimes they're under the surface. Either way, make sure that you give your employees a summary of the benefits if they successfully complete the project as well as the consequences if they don't.

When I say "consequences" here, I'm usually not talking about an ultimatum. Some managers might be able to do the whole, "fix it or you're fired!" thing, but that's not my style. When my employees are working on mission-critical projects I explain to them how their work will have an impact on the startup and how we all will benefit if it's executed well. If not, we may miss a deadline, lose out on serious sales money, or lose the trust of our fellow team members. All those are bad enough that you don't need to hang someone's job over their head.
