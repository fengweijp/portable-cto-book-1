# 6. Networking

How do you get a job as a CTO at a startup? When you do get one, how do you find people to hire? Once you've hired some people, how do you keep up with what's going on in the greater ecosystem?

Every job I've had besides my first internship in college came from someone I knew. I got my second internship because I knew another intern there from my engineering fraternity, my third internship was with a couple of friends I went to bars with regularly, my first job at a startup came after attempting to partner with them, and my next two jobs leading engineering teams at startups came from meeting founders at pitch events and keeping in touch for months.

Networking rarely bears fruit from day one, so I think a lot of people give up on it quickly. For some reason we accept that personal and romantic relationships take time to build, but business relationships are dropped as soon as we don't see a reason for them. Networking doesn't have to be slimy; it's just a fancy word for maintaining and building relationships. Often there's not a quid-pro-quo to be had, but that's okay. Every once in a while someone you know is the perfect person for something you need, or vice versa. That's when your network pays off.

## What is networking?

First, networking is not necessarily going to designated networking events to shake hands and make friends. I've tried this, but it feels unnatural to me, so I've developed a different approach.

### 1. Attend community events

If you are fortunate enough to live in a big city, there are probably dozens of professional groups that you can get involved in. If you're in a smaller town, keep a look out for virtual opportunities to get facetime with new people. Conferences, Meetup.com, clubs, and sports leagues are all great ways to branch out, so pick whatever you're most comfortable with.

### 2. Follow up with people

The key to attending events and making them productive is to follow up with people you meet. If you go to a meetup, shake hands with three or four people, and then never follow up your chances of making a meaningful connection is low. I've always had the best luck following up with a coffee or lunch meeting, and then taking it from there.

### 3. Say yes to new opportunities

Get in the habit of saying "Yes," when people invite you to things. I know, it's uncomfortable and risky and it might be a waste of time, but this is how you discover new groups of people. I'm not a party person, but I try to tag along with a friend to one or two group outings per month just to expose myself to new cliques.

### 4. Give back

Finally, volunteering, teaching, or speaking are all great ways to meet new people. If you've ever been to a conference you probably know that the best way to meet people is to be a speaker at the conference. Similarly, doing a guest lecture for a school or code bootcamp can put you in front of a totally new group of developers. Not only is this good for you, it's great for your company's long term brand.

## A system for keeping in touch

I first started using a system for keeping in touch with important people in my life in college. I realized that if I wasn't intentional about it, I wouldn't be able to keep up with a few dozen coworkers, mentors, friends, and peers, so [I started keeping a list of people](

I have a Google document of my most important contacts that I update regularly as I fall out of touch with some and add new ones to the list. I try to keep the number of people to less than 50, but sometimes it spills over a bit. In order to keep up with them, I set a reminder in my Google calendar to send each of them a personal email every three months. Does this take a lot of time? Yes. Is this worth every second? Also, yes. So, if you want to become an expert in networking, you have to keep in touch with people in a personal way. It doesn't matter if you're the CEO of Google or a Freshman in college; the formula for building a supportive and connected network takes time and effort. That's why so few people do it well, but those of us in marketing know the importance of building a solid network. If you do want to have people you can turn to when you need them, here's how you can do it:

### A guide to making your own quarterly contact list

*   **First, figure out who should be on your list.** Go through your LinkedIn contacts, Facebook friends, and Twitter followers looking for people from your network who you want to keep up with. Don't just choose people based on what they can do for you; choose people with high potential who are both above and below your professional level. Good networkers help more than they receive help, and you never know when that kid who just graduated might turn out to be the next Mark Zuckerburg.
*   **Next, choose the best way to contact them.** If you've emailed with them before, this is probably the best way to get in touch with them. If you've only talked to them on the phone, that's your ticket. Try to take your communication off of social media, but if you have to, send them a Twitter or Facebook message.
*   **Save one piece of personal information about your relationship.** My quarterly contact list has 4 columns: name, email, phone number, and relationship information. That last column is important because that's where I keep a record of the last thing we talked about or the last personal update I got from their life. You'd be amazed how excited people get when you send them an email and actually remember that they just had a baby 6 months ago.
*   **Make a clear and unavoidable reminder.** It's easy to forget to send everyone in your contact list a message every three months, so make your reminder unavoidable if possible. I set up a Google calendar event with an email alert to tell me when it's time to reach out to everyone on my list, but you should choose the method that works best for you. If you don't have a failsafe method, try [Follow Up Then](http://www.followupthen.com/) for making your reminder.
*   **Don't just ask for something.** When you send each person in your list a personal email, it's okay to mention what you're working on in passing, but it's not okay to simply ask them for something. Instead, ask them about what they're doing; offer to help them; show interest in their life. I've said this before, but once again, good networkers help more than they ask for help.
*   **Reserve time to send and respond to emails.** A lot of people avoid doing this because they don't want to invest the time required to follow up and read all the email messages that they'll inevitably get back. That's an extremely short-sighted way of looking at things, so reserve a day or two to read and respond to everyone individually. They'll be impressed with your effort, and know that you care enough to make time for them.

Building and maintaining relationships with professional contacts takes time and effort, but if you take a focused approach, it shouldn't be hard to do. If you've got your own tips for keeping up with people, feel free to leave them in the comments below.
