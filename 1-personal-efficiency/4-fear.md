# Dealing with Fear and Uncertainty

I remember vividly the feeling I got when I was put in charge of my first real team of engineers. I got pulled into an unscheduled meeting with our CEO and COO on a Wednesday afternoon. They told me that my boss - our company's Head of Engineering - was leaving in two weeks and that they wanted me to take over his role.

I had managed small teams of writers in college and just afterward, and I started this job managing a couple contractors overseas, but leading and building our engineering team of five at a quickly growing startup felt like a big leap. How would I get the team to respect me? I was younger than most of them, and hadn't really been a developer that long. Would I have the courage to stand up for their interest in company meetings? How would the new engineers feel about getting a new boss just after they started work?

The company's makeup had dramatically changed over my first year and a half there, and now, just as things were starting to stabilize and our engineering team was picking up steam, our leader was moving on and I was going to have to step up.

I'm an ambitious individual, so you might think I was excited - and maybe part of me was - but the only feeling I vividly remember was fear.

I walked out of the meeting with the founders a bit shaky and tried to focus on getting some work done for the rest of the day. I went home and kept my girlfriend up late talking about what I should do and how I was going to deal with this new role. I felt completely unprepared and uncertain.

## Imposter Syndrome

I've talked to countless CTOs and engineering managers since then, and I now realize that this feeling of inadequacy is far from exceptional. In fact, [most people will have this feeling at some point in their career](http://bsris.swu.ac.th/journal/i6/6-6_Jaruwan_73-92.pdf), which is why we have a name for it: imposter syndrome.

I'm not going to try to give you a cure-all for this feeling. If it's your first time managing a team, you're probably going to get it at some point, and hopefully you have a supportive network of mentors within and outside your company to help you out.

That said, here's what has helped me keep imposter syndrome from paralyzing me:

### 1. Talk through the feelings

Having people around you who you trust and can go to when you feel overwhelmed or unworthy is the biggest career asset you can have. I have a few close mentors who are years ahead of me on the leadership journey, a wonderful fiancee who also holds a position of leadership in her profession, and have had great coworkers at various places along the way.

It's hard to admit that you don't feel adequate for your job, but it's okay. Remember 70% of people have felt this way, so chances are that your support network has been in your shoes.

### 2. Keep the big picture in mind

Going back to my point in chapter 2, most of the little decisions you make during a typical week are not actually as big a deal as you think they are when you visualize the big picture. Your company may succeed or fail, but it's unlikely that you will be the sole root cause of either of those. If you feel like you are, ask your leadership team how they feel about it. If they feel like you're the right person for your job there's probably a reason for it.

### 3. Be honest with your team

Finally, I am honest with my teammates in one-on-ones and group settings. When I don't know the best decision to make, I tell them. This is a sign of humanity, not weakness, and it increases their empathy for you as a leader. It also gives them a chance to step up and help you out if they know you feel a bit overwhelmed.

## Uncertainty

Leaders often must make decisions with incomplete information. When I joined The Graide Network in 2016, I spent a lot of time talking with the founders about the requirements of their platform. The first version was unreliable and had fundamental flaws in the way data was stored, so like many companies dealing with a legacy software stack, we faced a choice between rebuilding or refactoring.

Rebuilding meant we could throw the mess out and restart the project based on the features we knew it had to have. We could eliminate inefficiencies, unit test everything, and in three to six months, probably be back where we started.

Refactoring would be a longer, but likely safer road. Every project has the spec that engineers know about and the spec that is locked away in the business team's mind. What I mean is that even if we attempted to catalog all the features of The Graide Network's platform, we'd constantly be discovering or remembering new ones.

This system was over a year old and had undergone many upgrades, so things were patched on top of each other in a way that made relying on the code for spec nearly impossible. Rebuilding from the ground up would likely take longer than we thought, and making reasonable estimates was impossible. Plus, we'd have to maintain the older system while the new one came online, and that would only slow things down more.

I did not have a template for dealing with this kind of problem yet, and the rest of my team was not technical, so they really didn't know where to start. This wasn't my first time dealing with uncertainty though, so I had an idea of where to start with making this decision.

### 1. Gather details

### 2. Talk to your mentors

### 3. Balance reasoning with your gut
