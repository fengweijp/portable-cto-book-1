# 5. Striking a Balance

I'm a firm believer in balance, but I didn't used to be. When I was younger, I believed that entrepreneurs got ahead by working harder than those around them, so I stayed up late, ignored my personal health, and worked as much as I could. It wasn't sustainable for me, and it probably won't be for you. I know that you may not believe me, but when you're at the edge of your rope and ready to build balance into your life you can come back to this. It'll be here; I promise.

## Pushing too hard

When I was pushing myself too hard, I didn't spend time meeting people or have any time to unwind and actually think strategically. I was constantly moving, so it was impossible to pick my head up and see the big picture.

If you're moving to a CTO role for the first time finding this balance may be an adjustment. Unlike your work as an engineer, you're going to be expected to know what's going on in the technology landscape - who's hiring, firing, and what other companies just got funded - as well as what's going on in your company's day-to-day.

Finding the right balance is hard. Every CTO I know who's grown a startup from 5 or 10 people to a hundred has cited this as the biggest challenge. Not only will you need to stop coding once in a while, you'll need to start reading; taking meetings with customers and partners; building a network; and taking better care of yourself.

## Where does personal health come in?

It may seem a little out of place in a book about patterns for startup CTOs, but your mind (and the body that carries it) is your greatest asset. It's the reason you got picked for this job, and it'll be the reason you stay in it or the reason you move on to something better someday. If your business is picking up steam, but your personal health is in freefall, you won't have the stamina to stay in the game when your company hits an inevitable speed bump.
