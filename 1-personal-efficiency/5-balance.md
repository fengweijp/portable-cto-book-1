# 5. Striking a Balance

I'm a firm believer in balance, but I didn't used to be. When I was younger, I believed that entrepreneurs got ahead by working harder than those around them, so I stayed up late, ignored my personal health, and worked as much as I could.

It wasn't sustainable for me, and it probably won't be for most of you. I know that you may not believe me, but when you're at the edge of your rope and ready to build balance into your life you can come back to this. It'll be here; I promise.
