# 5. Striking a Balance

I'm a firm believer in balance, but I didn't used to be. When I was younger, I believed that entrepreneurs got ahead by working harder than those around them, so I stayed up late, ignored my personal health, and worked as much as I could. It wasn't sustainable for me, and it probably won't be for you. I know that you may not believe me, but when you're at the edge of your rope and ready to build balance into your life you can come back to this. It'll be here; I promise.

## Pushing too hard

When I was pushing myself too hard, I didn't spend time meeting people or have any time to unwind and actually think strategically. I was constantly moving, so it was impossible to pick my head up and see the big picture.

If you're moving to a CTO role for the first time finding this balance may be an adjustment. Unlike your work as an engineer, you're going to be expected to know what's going on in the technology landscape - who's hiring, firing, and what other companies just got funded - as well as what's going on in your company's day-to-day.

Finding the right balance is hard. Every CTO I know who's grown a startup from 5 or 10 people to a hundred has cited this as the biggest challenge. Not only will you need to stop coding once in a while, you'll need to start reading; taking meetings with customers and partners; building a network; and taking better care of yourself.

## Where does personal health come in?

It may seem a little out of place in a book about patterns for startup CTOs, but your mind (and the body that carries it) is your greatest asset. It's the reason you got picked for this job, and it'll be the reason you stay in it or the reason you move on to something better someday. If your business is picking up steam, but your personal health is in freefall, you won't have the stamina to stay in the game when your company hits an inevitable speed bump.

Scott Adams, a writer, engineer, and the creator of Dilbert has [this to say about fitness](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/103051087451/health-as-a-competitive-edge):

> "Fit people have more energy to put into every task. And we all know that humans perform better when they have more energy. Studies back that observation...Energy influences your optimism, your ambition, and how others see you. Those are big deals too."

So [make a long term investment in yourself](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/health-investment-success) by eating well, working out at least three times per week, and avoiding excess.

## Financial success beyond the IPO

If you're in your 20's working at a startup, your retirement plan is probably to cash in all those sweet, sweet shares once your startup goes for an IPO (initial public offering). This is a [terrible long-term financial plan](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-retirement). Even a significant amount of equity in an early stage startup will get diluted, exit events are pretty rare, and without one [that stock may never turn into cash](https://www.quora.com/If-a-startup-doesnt-issue-an-IPO-isnt-acquired-will-an-employees-equity-ever-be-worth-anything). Finally, most employees get "Common Stock" which means that they won't get any payout [until after investors have made their money back and more](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/negotiating-equity-what-is-the-total-preference/2014/2/13). While equity can be a great cushion for your portfolio, it's never a good idea to put all your eggs into one basket.

Fortunately, creating a financial plan is easier now than ever before. There are a ton of great resources available (check out the end of [this article](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-retirement) for some of my favorites), and financial management software tools are cheaper and more accessible than ever before. Invest a few hours figuring out how much you can save outside your startup and you'll thank yourself when you actually get to retire someday.

## Social time

I still struggle with this, but social interactions beyond your job are an [important part of personal mental health](https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/living-long-well-21st-century-strategic-directions-research-aging/research-suggests-positive) and success. I have been lucky to work with great people at startups over the past six years, but I've also made a concerted effort to spend time with people outside my businesses. Professional groups, sporting events, concerts, and clubs are all great ways to find a consistent group of peers to socialize with.

Another habit I've gotten into is meeting a new person every week. It doesn't have to be a really deep meeting - just starting a conversation with a person in line at the grocery store counts in my book - but the feeling of connecting with a new human is exciting and it makes me more open in other parts of my life as well.

Meeting and staying in touch with people is its own topic though, which is where the next chapter takes us.
