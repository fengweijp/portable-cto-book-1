# 3. Batching, Focusing, and Delegating

Effective engineering managers must first learn to be effective and efficient engineers. If you're spending every day as a CTO spinning your wheels by bouncing between meetings, answering questions, and things aren't getting done, you've got a problem.

I've found three ideas to be essential for improving my personal productivity as an engineer and engineering leader or CTO. While your strategy for doing these same things may be different, you must learn to focus, batch, and delegate tasks.

## 1. Focusing on the Most Important Tasks

## 2. Batching Similar Work

## 3. Delegating Projects

A couple of years ago I got to meet and learn from [Nick Sarillo](http://www.nicksarillo.com/), a Chicago restraunt entrepreneur who's been repeatedly recognized for turning out successful restaurants and having engaged, interested employees. Like most new managers, Nick struggled with delegation when he was new at it too. He would try handing off important tasks to his team and then when someone dropped the ball he'd kick himself for not just doing it on his own.

Nick spent a lot of time figuring out delegation though. Unlike a one or two-person software startup, you can't run multiple successful pizza restaurants without being able to delegate, and since many of Nick's employees are high school or college kids, he's really had to think about how he can do it while keeping their chances of failure low.

This framework really resonated with me as a new manager. I have always struggled with giving important tasks to other people. While reading the words here won't fix all your problems, I hope you can take this framework and start using it to build your own system for delegation.

### A Framework for Delegation

#### What
The most obvious spot for delegation to fail is in the "What needs to be done" phase. As a manager, you must outline the expected result in no uncertain terms, and you can't assume that your employees know the same context that you do. Remember, they probably aren't in the same higher-level business meetings as you, so they may not know exactly what you expect from them.

I find this especially important when delegating open-ended research tasks. For example, if I wanted an employee to evaluate a new programming language, framework, or library, I wouldn't give them a task to "Evaluate X". I'd give them a matrix of things I wanted to know about the different options and ask them to fill it out.

Yes, defining a specific "What" like this takes more time than being vague, but the results - the thing we really care about - are much better.

- Why
- Who
- How
- When
- Check for understanding
- Benefits and consequences
