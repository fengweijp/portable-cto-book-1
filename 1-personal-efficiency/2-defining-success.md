# 2. Defining Success

Now that you know a little more about your role as a startup CTO, let's look at what it takes to be successful in that role, and how this differs from success in other roles.

At established companies in roles like product manager or software engineer, your success is usually dictated from your manager. You might have half a dozen KPIs (key performance indicators) or be given a checklist of projects to complete each quarter. At a startup, when you're one of the first team members, you're unlikely to get something this structured.

As the CTO, you are an executive level team member - even if your job in the beginning is mostly just writing code - so your success is more big-picture than a typical engineer's. This is one of the toughest things for new CTOs to get used to, but nobody is going to tell you with 100% certainty that if you do X, Y, and Z, you will have succeeded in your role.

The problem is that in a growth company, the priorities are changing too quickly. You can't expect a company with four or fewer quarters of history to predict performance or product initiatives very accurately for the upcoming year. Instead, your success must be more holistic; you msut let go of your desire to crank out more features, lower your defect rate, or ship more code and instead focus on making your company a success.

## The Elements of Success

If the startup you work for gets sold for $100+ million, will you feel like you're a "success?" What if your company falls apart without making any money? What if you get let go by your cofounders or fired by the board of directors? What if you have to downsize in three years?

I've met startup founders and employees who have gone through all of these scenarios, but despite what you may expect, many of the founders who faced the failure of their company came out the other side looking rather successful as individuals.

So there are two levels of success for an executive at a startup:

1. The success of your company
2. The personal success of the founder

You can easily find personal success without starting a successful company because you have [a great degree of control over your own personal success](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/success-is-in-your-attitude), while your startup's success is [dependant on many factors - some of which you cannot control](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed). In the long-term, the success of one or more companies that you start or work for is far less important than your personal success, but most of this book is about the technical and non-technical work you can do to help make your company successful. For the remainder of this section, we'll be talking about habits and patterns you can develop for your own personal success and efficiency.

## Personal Success

It's hard for entrepreneurs - especially those early in their career - to separate themselves from their companies. When I first joined a startup in 2012 I was one of six full-time team members. I would work on projects 10 to 12 hours per day, then answer emails and catch up on administrative work after that. When users were critical of the company or our products, I took it personally, and if my ideas didn't work out, I had trouble admitting that they failed so I stuck with them for way too long.

Looking back, I can see that this stemmed from my personal insecurities and the thought that if I started my career with a startup that failed, I'd go nowhere. I was naive, out of balance, and unsatisfied with my career.

After a few years as a member of early stage companies, I have realized that startups come and go, but your health, sanity, and happiness are going to stick with you for as long as you live. You can neglect your personal success in favor of helping your company succeed, but only for a time. I don't believe that in order to work at a startup you have to throw your life completely out of balance, and in fact, I believe that the best and happiest startup employees have realized how to focus on their business while maintaining a successful personal life as well.

## Patterns for Personal Success

If you're looking to find some balance in your life as a CTO, there are some patterns that can help you. These are mindset changes that won't happen overnight, so just reading this chapter probably won't change your world. You may not really absorb them until you've tried it your own way, and maybe you'll strike a balance without them, but here's what I have tried to do to balance my personal success with that of my startup's.

### 1. Changes Happen

If you're used to working in larger organizations, it can be hard to get used to the pace of change in startups. Not only will your company's priorities change as it finds [product-market fit](https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/product-market-fit-what-it-really-means-how-to-measure-it-and-where-to-find-it-70e746be907b#.kmwez7gcm), you'll be faced with new opportunities that will change your roadmap, you'll lose key employees and velocity without warning, your company's founders will come up with new ideas to chase, or someone will want to chase the latest technology craze.

While it's not responsible to let all these things happen at once - too much change is bad for any team or business - some change is inevitable in an early stage company. Your attitude should be that change is okay. Make it your mission to be the voice of calm in stormy seasons; keep meetings focused even when it seems like the sky is falling; be ready to ride the waves of change.

There are many things you can do to deal with change in your company. At their heart, many of the personal and product development topics in this book boil down to managing changing priorities in a sane and organized way. Just because things are in turmoil doesn't mean that you have to just let them fall apart.

### 2. Think in Terms of Long-Term Success

When you're running the day-to-day technology operations inside a small business, it's often easy to miss the forest for the trees. Today's problems often overshadow the long-term vison for the company and even your long-term personal success.

One habit I've gotten into to help keep my brain focused on the long-term is to frequently [visualize what success looks like in the long-term](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242373). For me, that long-term success is leading a team in a stable business that I helped build, doing work I love, inspiring and teaching others, and being able to balance a healthy, happy home life. When I get worried about the tiny day-to-day problems that any startup CTO faces - bugs, data loss, downtime - I pull back and ask myself, "Does this really matter that much in my vision for long-term success?" The answer is frequently, "No."

### 3. Create Goals Outside Your Business

If you had to write down five goals for yourself this year, what would they be? Hire a new employee? Finish a big project? Get out from under your legacy code? Write more unit tests?

All of these are fine goals (although a couple lack the specificity of [SMART goals](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php)), but what about setting some goals outside your startup?

If you're a founder or early employee, you probably tie much of your personal success to that of your business, but this will lead you take things too personally and prevent you from making objective leadership decisions. Your company should be just one of the areas of your life from which you set goals.

### 4. Seek Balance
