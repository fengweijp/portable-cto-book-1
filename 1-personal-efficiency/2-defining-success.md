# 2. Defining Success

Now that you know a little more about your role as a startup CTO, let's look at what it takes to be successful in that role, and how this differs from success in other roles.

At established companies in roles like product manager or software engineer, your success is usually dictated from your manager. You might have half a dozen KPIs (key performance indicators) or be given a checklist of projects to complete each quarter. At a startup, when you're one of the first team members, you're unlikely to get something this structured.

As the CTO, you are an executive level team member - even if your job in the beginning is mostly just writing code - so your success is more big-picture than a typical engineer's. This is one of the toughest things for new CTOs to get used to, but nobody is going to tell you with 100% certainty that if you do X, Y, and Z, you will have succeeded in your role.

The problem is that in a growth company, the priorities are changing too quickly. You can't expect a company with four or fewer quarters of history to predict performance or product initiatives very accurately for the upcoming year. Instead, your success must be more holistic; you msut let go of your desire to crank out more features, lower your defect rate, or ship more code and instead focus on making your company a success.

## The Elements of Success

If the startup you work for gets sold for $100+ million, will you feel like you're a "success?" What if your company falls apart without making any money? What if you get let go by your cofounders or fired by the board of directors? What if you have to downsize in three years?

I've met startup founders and employees who have gone through all of these scenarios, but despite what you may expect, many of the founders who faced the failure of their company came out the other side looking rather successful as individuals.

So there are two levels of success for an executive at a startup:

1. The success of your company
2. The personal success of the founder

You can easily find personal success without starting a successful company because you have [a great degree of control over your own personal success](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/success-is-in-your-attitude) while your startup's success is [dependant on many factors you cannot control](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed).
