# 2. Defining Success

Now that you know a little more about your role as a startup CTO, let's look at what it takes to be successful in that role, and how this differs from success in other roles.

At established companies in roles like product manager or software engineer, your success is usually dictated from your manager. You might have half a dozen KPIs (key performance indicators) or be given a checklist of projects to complete each quarter. At a startup, when you're one of the first team members, you're unlikely to get something this structured.

As the CTO, you are an executive level team member - even if your job in the beginning is mostly just writing code - so your success is more big-picture than a typical engineer's. This is one of the toughest things for new CTOs to get used to, but nobody is going to tell you with 100% certainty that if you do X, Y, and Z, you will have succeeded in your role.

The problem is that in a growth company, the priorities are changing too quickly. You can't expect a company with four or fewer quarters of history to predict performance or product initiatives very accurately for the upcoming year. Instead, your success must be more holistic; you msut let go of your desire to crank out more features, lower your defect rate, or ship more code and instead focus on making your company a success.

## The Elements of Success

If the startup you work for gets sold for $100+ million, will you feel like you're a "success?" What if your company falls apart without making any money? What if you get let go by your cofounders or fired by the board of directors? What if you have to downsize in three years?

I've met startup founders and employees who have gone through all of these scenarios, but despite what you may expect, many of the founders who faced the failure of their company came out the other side looking rather successful as individuals.

So there are two levels of success for an executive at a startup:

1. The success of your company
2. The personal success of the founder

You can easily find personal success without starting a successful company because you have [a great degree of control over your own personal success](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/success-is-in-your-attitude), while your startup's success is [dependant on many factors - some of which you cannot control](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed). In the long-term, the success of one or more companies that you start or work for is far less important than your personal success, but most of this book is about the technical and non-technical work you can do to help make your company successful. For the remainder of this section, we'll be talking about habits and patterns you can develop for your own personal success and efficiency.

## Personal Success

It's hard for entrepreneurs - especially those early in their career - to separate themselves from their companies. When I first joined a startup in 2012 I was one of six full-time team members. I would work on projects 10 to 12 hours per day, then answer emails and catch up on administrative work after that. When users were critical of the company or our products, I took it personally, and if my ideas didn't work out, I had trouble admitting that they failed so I stuck with them for way too long.

Looking back, I can see that this stemmed from my personal insecurities and the thought that if I started my career with a startup that failed, I'd go nowhere. I was naive, out of balance, and unsatisfied with my career.

After a few years as a member of early stage companies, I have realized that startups come and go, but your health, sanity, and happiness are going to stick with you for as long as you live. You can neglect your personal success in favor of helping your company succeed, but only for a time. I don't believe that in order to work at a startup you have to throw your life completely out of balance, and in fact, I believe that the best and happiest startup employees have realized how to focus on their business while maintaining a successful personal life as well.

## Patterns for Personal Success

If you're looking to find some balance in your life as a CTO, there are some patterns that can help you. These are mindset changes that won't happen overnight, so just reading this chapter probably won't change your world. You may not really absorb them until you've tried it your own way, and maybe you'll strike a balance without them, but here's what I have tried to do to balance my personal success with that of my startup's.

### 1. Develop an Attitude that Change is Okay


### 2. Think in Terms of Long-Term Success
